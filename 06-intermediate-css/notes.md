# Intermediate CSS

## What I learnt
    - Combining selectors:
        - Group selector: Apply to all the selector included (h1, h2).
        - Child selector: Apply to direct child of the parent (div > p).
        - Descendant: Apply to a descendant of left side (div p).
        - Chaining: Apply where all the selector is true (div.box#red-box).
        - Combining Combiners: Two or more from all method above.

    - CSS Position:
        - Static
        - Relative
        - Absolute
        - Fixxed
        - Sticky
