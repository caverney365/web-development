<h3>UI/UX Designer</h3>
<p>This is the foundation.</p>

<h3>Web Developer</h3>
<p>Apply my design skills into real sites</p>

<h3>Python Developer</h3>
<p>I'm lazy, I want to automate everything.</p>

<h4>Why I have to learn and master all of these?</h4>
<p>In this AI era, everything is should be easy because I don't have to know something, just ask AI.<br/>
But I have to know something and be able to do it, and use AI as an extension of my ability, not as my ability.
